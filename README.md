OpenSearch Plugin for generate QrCodes
======================================

Uses an online QrCode generator service. The plugin send the text searched 
to the API site and returns a picture of the QrCode representing the text.

I found this usefull as a simple alternative to copy-paste text from a desktop
pc to a mobile terminal.
Don't use this tool to convert passwords or other sensible data, everything you 
will convert will be sent to and external site where the effective operation 
will be performed.

I am not involved in the external site offering the QrCode generation API.
